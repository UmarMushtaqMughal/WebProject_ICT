            WELCOME TO Electrical Engineering

The future belongs to those who can innovate and possess the knowledge and tools to operate across disciplines. Electrical Engineering (EE) is one of the oldest disciplines of engineering and is still considered to be a mother discipline. At the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, we offer a high-quality inter-disciplinary PEC accredited program focusing on the Smart Grid, Micro Electronics, ASIC Design, Communication, Renewable Energy, Signal Processing and Control. Our goal is to prepare innovation-ready engineers with a flexible range of career paths.  Over the last twenty years, the Electrical Engineering program has produced 1500+ graduates now successfully contributing to a variety of industrial, research, business, and academic ventures.
